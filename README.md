# Maze Builder and Visualization

An interactive program built in [Processing](https://processing.org/) that allows users to customize mazes and test them using [Depth-First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) and [Breadth-First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) search techniques. These search algorithms that are utilized during the maze visualization are based upon their respective functionality within the application of binary trees.

## Usage
In order to run my program, you will need to download the [Processing](https://processing.org/) software. Once you have it downloaded, download all the proper files and folders and then click on any of the .pde to open the project.
